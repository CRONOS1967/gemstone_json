Treated diamonds are natural diamonds pass through treatment. Treated diamonds are improved in quality, modified with inclusions or enhanced with color diamonds. The three most common diamond treatment are laser drilling, fracture filling and high pressure (HPHT). Laser drilling- lasers are used to remove the inclusions in the diamonds. In laser drilling the inclusions become less visible. They are used to make included diamonds more marketable. Fracture filling- the other most common treatment method that is used for diamonds is fracture filling. it is filling glass like substance which has similar property with the diamon . It used to improve the visibility and clarity of the diamond and it can last for years. High temperature (HPHT)- high temperature is exposing it to high pressure.
